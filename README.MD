# Guided by signals
Welcome, Operator! You are here on a mission, to guide our pilots by giving them signals and destroy those rogue tanks! (Don't worry there are no humans inside).

# Gameplay
You attack by dropping payloads on the enemy tanks, but be careful:
- The plane takes time to reach destination (1.5 seconds for the whole map).
- The payload takes time to fall (0.7 seconds).
- A single payload can destroy multiple enemies.

If an enemy reaches the end of the map, it penetrates your base and you lose 1 HP.

You pass the day by meeting the daily quota, the qouta increases by 10 every day!

# Ending
If your base loses all HP it's destroyed and the game ends.
If you survive the day, your crew can repair up to 10 HP of the base (maximum 100 HP).

# Aim Assist
There is also an Aim Assist option - it shows lines your enemies will follow as well as the time it takes them to get there, there is also a line following the player that show the time it takes the plane to get to the mark point (it doesn't count the time it takes for the the payload to fall)
