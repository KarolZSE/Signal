# IMPORTANT !!! There are loud sounds in the game please turn down your volume!!!

# To the stonemason that reviewed my project
I sorry but I have no idea in which part you find the abusive use of AI. I tried asking you and you went in to a long sleep. I tried searching for the issue that could be marked as AI and the only thing I found is a generic Collision detection function, Fire in the hole sound - as attributed below to the elevenlabs.io (Ai company), m-dash in the name of the game (which I put there becouse a normal - (minus sign) didn't look so good and the long css, I cannot thing of anything else. I don't have a recording for my progress other then a github commit history, hackatime logs and a paper note with calculations for the 
time it takes for the plane to fly over to a clicked point in the payload drop.

# Guided by signals
Welcome, Operator! You are here on a mission, to guide our pilots by giving them signals and destroy those rogue tanks! (Don't worry there are no humans inside).

# Gameplay
You attack by dropping (with the left click of a mouse) payloads on the enemy tanks, but be careful:
- The plane takes time to reach destination (1.5 seconds for the whole map).
- The payload takes time to fall (0.7 seconds).
- A single payload can destroy multiple enemies.

If an enemy reaches the end of the map, it penetrates your base and you lose 1 HP.
(You can see the HP on the bar on the top of the page)

You pass the day by meeting the daily quota, the qouta increases by 10 every day!
(You can see the Qouta right under the health bar)

# Ending
If your base loses all HP it's destroyed and the game ends.
If you survive the day, your crew can repair up to 10 HP of the base (maximum 100 HP).

# Aim Assist
There is also an Aim Assist option - it shows lines your enemies will follow as well as the time it takes them to get there, there is also a line following the player that show the time it takes the plane to get to the mark point (it doesn't count the time it takes for the the payload to fall)
